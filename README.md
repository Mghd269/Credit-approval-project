# Credit Approval Classification Project

## Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model for classifying credit approval using a dataset containing information about loan applicants. The dataset provides insights into various attributes of applicants, including demographic details, financial status, and employment history. The goal is to build a predictive model that can assess the risk associated with loan applicants, helping financial institutions make informed decisions about credit approval.

## Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project can be accessed from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohit265/loan-approval-dataset?resource=download). It consists of the following attributes:

- **Id:** Unique identifier for each loan applicant.
- **Income:** The income level of the applicant.
- **Age:** Age of the applicant.
- **Experience:** Years of professional experience.
- **Married/Single:** Marital status of the applicant.
- **House_Ownership:** Indicates whether the applicant owns or rents a house.
- **Car_Ownership:** Indicates whether the applicant owns a car.
- **Profession:** Occupation or profession of the applicant.
- **CITY:** City of residence of the applicant.
- **STATE:** State of residence of the applicant.
- **CURRENT_JOB_YRS:** Duration of employment in the current job.
- **CURRENT_HOUSE_YRS:** Duration of residence in the current house.
- **Risk_Flag:** Binary indicator of loan risk, where 1 represents a flagged risky applicant and 0 represents a non-risky applicant.

The dataset contains both numerical and categorical features, making it suitable for various analytical approaches. With 252,000 entries, it offers a comprehensive overview of loan applicants' profiles, facilitating analysis and modeling for risk assessment and decision-making in lending processes.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to develop a classification model that accurately predicts the risk associated with loan applicants based on their attributes. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we aim to assist financial institutions in automating the credit approval process and mitigating potential risks.

## Implementation

The project will involve the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preprocessing the dataset to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize numerical features.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyzing the dataset to gain insights into the distribution of features, correlations, and potential patterns that may influence credit risk.

3. **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features or transforming existing ones to enhance the predictive power of the model.

4. **Model Selection:** Evaluating various classification algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting to identify the best-performing model.

5. **Model Training:** Training the selected model on the preprocessed dataset using appropriate training and validation techniques.

6. **Model Evaluation:** Assessing the performance of the trained model using relevant evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
